Automated Database Backup Script - PostgreSQL

# Automated Database Backup Script

## Overview

This project guides you through writing a simple script (Shell/Python) to automate the backup of a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) running on AWS. lets learn to schedule the script using cron jobs or AWS CloudWatch Events. This project is designed to help you understand basic scripting, automation, and scheduling tasks.

## Project Structure

- **`backup_script.sh` (or `backup_script.py`):** The script responsible for initiating the database backup.
- **`README.md`:** Project documentation providing instructions and information.

## Prerequisites

1. **Database Setup:** Ensure you have a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) running on AWS that you want to back up.

2. **Scripting Language:** Choose either Shell or Python, depending on your preference.

3. **AWS Credentials:** Configure AWS CLI with the necessary credentials to interact with AWS services.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-database-backup-script.git
   cd automated-database-backup-script
   ```

2. **Configure Script:**
   - Open the `backup_script.sh` (or `backup_script.py`) file.
   - Modify any configuration parameters such as database connection details, backup location, etc.

3. **Run the Script Manually:**
   - Test the script by running it manually to ensure it performs the backup successfully.

4. **Schedule Using Cron (Linux) or CloudWatch Events (AWS):**
   - **Cron Job (Linux):** Set up a cron job to run the script at scheduled intervals.
   - **AWS CloudWatch Events:** Create a CloudWatch Event Rule to trigger the script based on a schedule.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script based on your database and backup requirements. You can add additional logic, error handling, or integrate with other AWS services if needed.
